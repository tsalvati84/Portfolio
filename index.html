      <p> I grew up in Chicago but haved lived in Arizona since I was about 13.
         I grew up playing sports like baseball, soccer, and also use to
         skateboard for about 15 years. Im a huge fan of the Blackhawks,
         Bears, and White Sox. I enjoy going out to new bars, restaurants,
         and trying new craft beers in the valley. I also recently purchased
         a Nissan 350z Roadster that I plan to rebuild. </p>
        
          
         <p> My goal after this course is to find a great job in web design. I've had the chance to work for some big
        tech companies and I look forward to increasing my skills and working hard to be more successful! </p>
